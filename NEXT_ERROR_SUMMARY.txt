# 'next' Command Error - Execution Summary

## Problem
```
'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command
npm run dev fails
```

## Root Cause
```
Updated package.json (3.4.1)
         ↓
❌ Didn't delete package-lock.json (still had 4.1.17)
         ↓
npm install saw conflict
         ↓
Installation partially failed
         ↓
node_modules incomplete (missing Next.js binary)
         ↓
'next' command not found
```

## Solution

### DELETE These
1. Folder: `node_modules/` (entire folder)
2. File: `package-lock.json`

### RUN This
```powershell
npm install
```

### VERIFY
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Should start server at http://localhost:3000

## Why This Works

|--------|--------|
| Delete node_modules | Forces complete rebuild |

| Result | Complete, correct installation |

## Quick Steps

```
1. Delete node_modules folder
2. Delete package-lock.json file
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npm run dev
5. Done!
